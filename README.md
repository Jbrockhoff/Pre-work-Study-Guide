# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## A study guide for students completing prework for KU full-stack coding bootcamp

I wanted to immerse myself in practical application of skills to help me begin to use the course material. I built it in order to have a basis of comparison among peers in class and to understand how to build a webpage. It gives me a place to take and store notes in an easily-accessible way, and I learned everything! I got expereince in coding, which I have never done before. 


If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

To use this Prework Study Guide, you can review the notes in each section. For suggestions on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.
